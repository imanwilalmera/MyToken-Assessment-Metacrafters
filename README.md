# MyToken-Assessment-Metacrafters

# Simple overview of use/purpose
MyToken is a Solidity smart contract that implements a basic ERC20-like token functionality, allowing users to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens that have been eposited.

# Description
MyToken is a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate the creation and management of custom tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functionalities such as minting new tokens and burning existing tokens, as well as storing token metadata such as token name, token abbreviation, and total token supply. This contract serves as a foundational building block for tokenization projects on the Ethereum platform.

# Getting Started
Installing
To use the MyToken contract, you can either deploy it on your local development environment or on a public Ethereum network.

1. Download: You can download the contract code from here.
2. Modifications: No modifications are needed to the contract files.

# Executing program
To deploy and interact with the MyToken contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy Contract: Deploy the MyToken contract to an Ethereum network of your choice. Personally, I have chosen Remix for this.
2. Interact with Contract: Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using Ethereum wallet applications like MetaMask or through custom dApps.
